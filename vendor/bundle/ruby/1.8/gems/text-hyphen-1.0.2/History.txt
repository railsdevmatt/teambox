== 1.0.2 / unreleased
* Moved to 'hoe' and GitHub.
* Preparing for 2.0 which will be Ruby 1.9-only for UTF-8.
* Fixing German support (RubyForge 28498):
  * Choosing 'de' as a language will load 'de1'. Choosing 'de1' or 'de2' will
    load properly now, but they will be reported with an ISO language code of
    'de' (new optional #isocode attribute on a language definition that will
    override the #iso_language setting of a Text::Hyphen instance if set).
  * Both 'de1' and 'de2' can be loaded simultaneously now, but the first one
    loaded will claim the Text::Hyphen::Language::DE constant.
* Added test cases for bugs:
  * RubyForge 9807 (cannot reproduce)
  * RubyForge 28128 (cannot reproduce)
  * RubyForge 28498

== 1.0.1
* Minor modification to the RubyGem release of Text::Hyphen to enable the
  hyphen command-line program.

== 1.0.0
* Initial version based on TeX::Hyphen 0.4.0 (some changes have been
  backported to TeX::Hyphen 0.5.0). 
* Incorporated many hyphenation pattern files from CTAN.
